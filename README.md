# Data-Project---Marketing-Segmentation-Department
K-Means algorithm

One of the critical points for marketing is knowing your customers and identifying their needs.

By understanding the customer, specialists can launch targeted marketing campaigns that are tailored to specific needs.
If customer data is available, data science can be applied to perform segmentation.

In this case study, we will act as a consultant in a NY bank

The bank has extensive data on its customers for the last 6 months

The bank's marketing team wants to launch a targeted advertising campaign by dividing its customers into at least 3 different groups.

We will use the K-Means algorithm to determine these groups based on the number of variables provided by the bank. To do this, we will select the optimal number of clusters (K).

For the analysis, we will use PCA to reduce dimensionality and improve visualization.
